### How to Publish The Orb
* Create and push a branch with your new features.
* When ready to publish a new production version, create a Pull Request from _feature branch_ to `main`.
* The title of the pull request must contain a special semver tag: `[semver:minor]`. 
* example: `[semver:minor] Added support for windows`
* Squash and merge. Ensure the semver tag is preserved and entered as a part of the commit message.
* On merge, after manual approval, the orb will automatically be published to the Orb Registry.
